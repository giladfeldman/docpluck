## CHANGELOG-documented public-API names must be in `__all__` (caught 2026-05-07, v2.0.0 release)

**What:** v2.0.0 CHANGELOG line "`Cell, Table, Figure, StructuredResult` TypedDicts and `TABLE_EXTRACTION_VERSION` re-exported from top-level `docpluck`" was inaccurate — `Cell` was importable via `docpluck.tables.Cell` but not from top-level `docpluck`. Caught by /ship Phase 3 cleanup against `docpluck.__all__`.

**Why:** When implementing a new public-surface CHANGELOG entry, it's easy to write the docs from intent ("we expose Cell, Table, Figure...") then only re-export the ones actually used by the orchestrator (extract_pdf_structured uses Table + Figure but doesn't return Cell directly — so Cell got missed in the import line).

**Fix:** Added `Cell` to `from .tables import` and to `__all__`. Added regression test `tests/test_v2_top_level_exports.py` asserting every CHANGELOG-documented v2.0 name is both importable AND in `__all__`.

**How to detect:**
1. After writing a CHANGELOG entry that mentions "re-exported from top-level <pkg>", run:
   `python -c "import <pkg>; print(set(<pkg>.__all__) ^ {<documented names>})"`
2. The symmetric difference should be empty (or only contain the legitimate non-public names).
3. The `tests/test_v2_top_level_exports.py` regression test is the durable version of this check.
