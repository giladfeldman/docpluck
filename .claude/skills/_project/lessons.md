## CHANGELOG-documented public-API names must be in `__all__` (caught 2026-05-07, v2.0.0 release)

**What:** v2.0.0 CHANGELOG line "`Cell, Table, Figure, StructuredResult` TypedDicts and `TABLE_EXTRACTION_VERSION` re-exported from top-level `docpluck`" was inaccurate — `Cell` was importable via `docpluck.tables.Cell` but not from top-level `docpluck`. Caught by /ship Phase 3 cleanup against `docpluck.__all__`.

**Why:** When implementing a new public-surface CHANGELOG entry, it's easy to write the docs from intent ("we expose Cell, Table, Figure...") then only re-export the ones actually used by the orchestrator (extract_pdf_structured uses Table + Figure but doesn't return Cell directly — so Cell got missed in the import line).

**Fix:** Added `Cell` to `from .tables import` and to `__all__`. Added regression test `tests/test_v2_top_level_exports.py` asserting every CHANGELOG-documented v2.0 name is both importable AND in `__all__`.

**How to detect:**
1. After writing a CHANGELOG entry that mentions "re-exported from top-level <pkg>", run:
   `python -c "import <pkg>; print(set(<pkg>.__all__) ^ {<documented names>})"`
2. The symmetric difference should be empty (or only contain the legitimate non-public names).
3. The `tests/test_v2_top_level_exports.py` regression test is the durable version of this check.

## Hardcoded version-string assertions break every release-bump (caught 2026-05-09, v2.1.0 release)

**What:** v2.1.0 release bumped `SECTIONING_VERSION` 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 and `NORMALIZATION_VERSION` 1.6.0 → 1.7.0. Four tests had the OLD version strings hardcoded as bare equality assertions:
- `tests/test_sections_version.py::test_sectioning_version_is_v110` — `assert SECTIONING_VERSION == "1.1.0"`
- `tests/test_sections_public_api.py::test_sections_namespace_exports` — `assert SECTIONING_VERSION == "1.1.0"`
- `tests/test_cli_sections.py::test_cli_sections_json_output` — `assert payload["sectioning_version"] == "1.1.0"`
- `tests/test_d5_normalization_audit.py::TestVersionBumps` — `assert NORMALIZATION_VERSION == "1.6.0"` AND `assert report.version == "1.6.0"`

Plus three golden snapshot files (`tests/golden/sections/*.json`) had the version baked in as a JSON field, requiring `DOCPLUCK_REGEN_GOLDEN=1` to refresh.

**Why:** Each version-pin test was deliberately written to verify the constant is at the version the contributor expected — defensible as a tripwire. But that means EVERY release bump fails the full test suite until the pins are updated. The current pattern is a tax on every release rather than a meaningful invariant.

**Fix:** Updated all six call sites + 3 golden files to the new version. Renamed `test_sectioning_version_is_v110` → `test_sectioning_version_is_v120` so the function name doesn't lie about the assertion.

**How to detect (pre-tag):**
1. Before running the full suite post version-bump, grep the test tree:
   `grep -rn 'SECTIONING_VERSION\|NORMALIZATION_VERSION\|sectioning_version\|normalization_version' tests/ | grep -E '"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"'`
2. Every match is a candidate for update. Update them in the same commit as the version bump so the release commit stays atomic.

**How to detect (durable):** Add a test in v2.2.0+ that asserts `SECTIONING_VERSION == docpluck.sections.SECTIONING_VERSION` (self-referential, never breaks) and replaces the hardcoded-version pin tests entirely. Deferred for now — the cost of updating 6 sites once per minor release is low enough that this isn't worth the complexity yet.
